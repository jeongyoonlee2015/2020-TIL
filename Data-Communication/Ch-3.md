# Chapter 3 Datatransmission

### Data transmission 
> occurs between transmitter and receiver over some transmission medium.
### Communication 
> is in the form of electromagnetic waves.

1. Guided Media(Wired)<br>
* Twisted pair(TP; 전화선, 꼬임쌍선)
* Coaxial cable(동축 케이블; TV 안테나)
* Optical fiber(광섬유||장/단점알기)
2. Unguided media(wireless) <br>
* Propagation through air, vacuum, and seawater

#### Direct link (직접 연결: 중간노드 x)
> No intermediate devices other than amplifiers or repeaters used to increase signal strength
#### Point-to-point (점대점 연결)
> Direct link between two devices
#### Multi-point
> More than two devices share the same medium (e.g. 버스 구조)

#### Simplex(Unidirection; 단방향)
> Signals are transmitted in only one direction
#### Half duplex (Didirection; 양방향) (Alternately)
#### Full duplex (Simultaneously)

## Sine Wave(sine wave 3가지 특성)
> Fundamental periodic signal <br> can be represented by three parameters

* peak amplitude(A)
: Maximum value or strength of the signal over time(Time Domain)

* Frequency(f) (단위 시간: 1sec)
: Rate at which the signal repeats

* Phase
: Relative position in time within a single period of signal

## Types of Transmission
1. Asynchronous Transmission
> A strategy is to avoid the timing problem by not sending long uninterrupted streams of bits.
2. Synchronous Transmission
> A block of bits is transmitted in a steady stream without start and stop codes.
