#[TUM1]()

Probability theory stuff (various probability distributions especially Gaussian curve etc)
Basic Communication and Digital communication stuff etc
Basics of Linear Algebra e.g., Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, Rank of a matrix etc
Imp: Keep your cv with u and revise and go thru well whatever u have written in that, they will ask abt whtever u have mentioned in that.
Also in your application for admission, whatever you mentioned as interest and field.

the following are some of the questions which a current MSCE student gave me

1. What are random variables? Their distribution, particularly

gaussian and binomial distribution. What is pdf?

2. What is law of large numbers?

3. Types of transforms studied, like fourier, laplace etc

4. eigen values, what is characteristic equation?

5. probablity: what is conditional probablity, bayes theorem?
