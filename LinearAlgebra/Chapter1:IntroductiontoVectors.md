# Chapter1: Introduction to Vectors

## Vectors, Linear Combinations
* Zero vector<br>
  * Component: 0
  * Vector: 0
  
* Linear Combinations
<br>: The sum of cv and dw is a linear combination of v and w.

* Vectors in Three Dimensions
<br>: A vector with three components corresponds to a point in the three dimensional space.

## Lengths and Dot Products
: The dot product or inner product of v = (v1, v2) and w = (w1, w2) is the number v·w.
> v·w = v1w1 + v2w2 = w·v

#### Unit vectors
i(1,0)<br>
j(0,1)<br>
(cosθ, sinθ)<br>
u = v/||v||
* The dot product of a vector with itself gives the lenght of v suared.
> length = ||v|| = sqrt(v·v)
